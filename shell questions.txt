Given a sentence, identify and display its fourth word. Assume that the space (' ') is the only delimiter between words.

Input Format

A text file with lines of ASCII text only. Each line has exactly one sentence.

Constraints


(N is the number of lines of text in the input file)

Output Format

The output should contain N lines.

For each input sentence, identify and display its fourth word. Assume that the space (' ') is the only delimiter between words.

Sample Input

Hello
World
how are you
Sample Output

Hello

answer:

cut -d " " -f4

exp:From man cut:

   -f, --fields=LIST
          select only these fields;  also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless the -s option is specified
If a line contains 1 word, then it does not contain the delimiter and therefore cut prints the whole line (which is exactly that one word).

Other cases are obvious: the line contains at least one delimiter, therefore it prints the fourth word, if available.

If you add the -s parameter, it will print the fourth word only if available (and thus ignore lines with one word without delimiter).

**********************************

print to 20 lines in afile

head -n 20
***************
print the 20 charceters of a file

head -c 20
*****************
Display the lines (from line number 12 to 22, both inclusive) for the input file.

answ: head -n 22 | tail -11

exp:Print line between M and N lines(M>N): For this purpose, we use the head, tail, and pipeline(|) commands.
The command is: head -M file_name | tail +N since the head command takes first M lines and from M lines tail command cuts lines starting from +N till the end, 
we can also use head -M file_name | tail +(M-N+1) command since the head command takes first M lines and from M lines tail command cuts (M-N+1) lines starting from the end. 
Let say from the state.txt file we have to print lines between 10 and 20. 
 
**********************************

answer:
tr -s [:space:]

How to use squeeze repetition of characters using -s
To squeeze repeat occurrences of characters specified in a set use the -s option. This removes repeated instances of a character.
OR we can say that,you can convert multiple continuous spaces with a single space

$ echo "Welcome    To    GeeksforGeeks" | tr -s [:space:] ' '
Output:

Welcome To GeeksforGeeks
