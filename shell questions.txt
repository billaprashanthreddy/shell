answer:

cut -d " " -f4

exp:From man cut:

   -f, --fields=LIST
          select only these fields;  also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless the -s option is specified
If a line contains 1 word, then it does not contain the delimiter and therefore cut prints the whole line (which is exactly that one word).

Other cases are obvious: the line contains at least one delimiter, therefore it prints the fourth word, if available.

If you add the -s parameter, it will print the fourth word only if available (and thus ignore lines with one word without delimiter).

exp:Print line between M and N lines(M>N): For this purpose, we use the head, tail, and pipeline(|) commands.
The command is: head -M file_name | tail +N since the head command takes first M lines and from M lines tail command cuts lines starting from +N till the end, 
we can also use head -M file_name | tail +(M-N+1) command since the head command takes first M lines and from M lines tail command cuts (M-N+1) lines starting from the end.

Explanation 0

The data has been sorted in descending order of the average monthly temperature in January (i.e, the second column).

answer
sort -t$'\t' -k2 -rn

expla

t is the option used to set the field separator for sort.

$'\t' is the input to the option above. This tells sort that each field is separated by a horizontal tab.

If -t was left blank then it would default to empty spaces. Look at the man pages for sort and definitely read the link posted above after reading this. It should make more sense, the man pages can be difficult to understand sometimes.

TLDR: -t$'\t' basically tells the program to sort by tab.

*******************************
You are given a file of pipe-delimited weather data (TSV). There is no header column in this data file. The first five columns of this data are: (a) the name of the city (b) the average monthly temperature in Jan (in Fahreneit). (c) the average monthly temperature in April (in Fahreneit). (d) the average monthly temperature in July (in Fahreneit). (e) the average monthly temperature in October (in Fahreneit).

You need to sort this file in descending order of the second column (i.e. the average monthly temperature in January).

Input Format

A text file with multiple lines of pipe-delimited data. The first five fields have been explained above

Output Format

Sort the data in descending order of the average monthly temperature in January.

*********************
In this challenge, we practice using the uniq command to eliminate consecutive repetitions of a line when a text file is piped through it.

Given a text file, count the number of times each line repeats itself. Only consider consecutive repetitions. Display the space separated count and line, respectively. There shouldn't be any leading or trailing spaces. Please note that the uniq -c command by itself will generate the output in a different format than the one expected here.
